# JS_30

## I am learning Javascript and web-development from the JS30 original course-["JS30"](https://courses.wesbos.com/account/access/60d9fa788981fd4f94701c38).

### Day-1(DrumKit Project)
Learnt the following things : 
    - "<kbd> </kbd>" tag for keyboard input.
    - setTimer() in JS to delay some function.
    - working with audio in html files and playing them.
